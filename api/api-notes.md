# APIs
[Back To Main](../README.md)

* API: Application programming interface
  * Consists of a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects
  * Programmers can use these things to create software/interact
  with an external system
  * We can request for data from someone else's server through an api.
  The API will send a response of the data requested.
* We can use APIs so that we can utilize their data
  * openweathermap: get weather information
  * goodreads: access info about books users have saved
  * jQuery: gives you access to a bunch of functions and objects that help
  * JoseAPI: returns jokes
  you create software
* Concepts:
  * Endpoints : where APIs send requests and where an APIs resources are located
  * Paths : The full url path needed to access more specified data
  * Parameters : come after a `?` and specify what we are trying to reach
  * Authentication : when you make a request, the API needs to recognize you
  and know how often you are using their data (if you go over a threshold,
  they may try to charge for your usage or block further usage)
