# APIs
[Back To Main](../README.md)

# Basics
* `API` : Application programming interface
* Allows multiple softwares to exchange information
* How it works:
  * Make call from client to server 
  * Get data back via HTTP protocol 

# Main Concepts
* `Endpoints` : where APIs send requests and where an APIs resources are located
* `Paths` : The full url path needed to access more specified data
* `Parameters` : come after a `?` and specify what we are trying to reach
* `Authentication` : when you make a request, the API needs to recognize you
and know how often you are using their data (if you go over a threshold,
they may try to charge for your usage or block further usage)

# HTTP Request Methods
* GET : retrieve data
* POST : writing data to the API
  * put data in body of request

# Authentication
* Client ID and client secret exchanged for access token
* Access tokens are used to interact with the API

# Useful things
* POSTMAN
  * good for testing APIs
  * provides a user interface to help apply api keys and values
  * shows results in properly formatted JSON

# Old (to be edited / removed)

* API: Application programming interface
  * Consists of a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects
  * Programmers can use these things to create software/interact
  with an external system
  * We can request for data from someone else's server through an api.
  The API will send a response of the data requested.
* We can use APIs so that we can utilize their data
  * openweathermap: get weather information
  * goodreads: access info about books users have saved
  * jQuery: gives you access to a bunch of functions and objects that help
  * JoseAPI: returns jokes
  you create software
