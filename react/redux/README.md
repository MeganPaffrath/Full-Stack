# Get started

```
npx create-react-app app-name
cd app-name
npm install redux react-redux
```

# Notes

- store : holds all data of application
- action : a function describing what should be done
- reducer : describes how actions transform the state
- dispatch : executes the action (sends action to reducer, reducer then checks what to do and updates store)
