# Life
Motivation and concepts towards growth

# Accountibility
* Publicly anounce your goals
    * When we tell others what we are going to achieve, we are better at reaching our goals
    * Publicly documenting your journey: 
        * ex: 100 days of code on twitter
# Hard Workers
* Surrounding yourself with hard workers makes you want to be a harder worker

# Routine
* Having a daily routine is important
* Try doing your hardest tasks in a day first

# Deep Work
* Just being at your desk does not mean you are working. It is important to be in a state of flow.
* Really separate work from other tasks. Put all attention into this one thing. Avoid thinking about other things and doing other things.
