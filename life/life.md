# Life

Motivation and concepts towards growth

# Staying up to date

- It is important to stay up to date with new technologies
  - by staying up to date, you become a more valuable developer

# Accountibility

- Publicly anounce your goals
  - When we tell others what we are going to achieve, we are better at reaching our goals
  - Publicly documenting your journey:
    - ex: 100 days of code on twitter

# Hard Workers

- Surrounding yourself with hard workers makes you want to be a harder worker

# Routine

- Having a daily routine is important
- Try doing your hardest tasks in a day first

# Deep Work

- Just being at your desk does not mean you are working. It is important to be in a state of flow.
- Really separate work from other tasks. Put all attention into this one thing. Avoid thinking about other things and doing other things.
