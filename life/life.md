# Life
Motivation and concepts towards growth

# Accountibility
* Publicly anounce your goals
    * When we tell others what we are going to achieve, we are better at reaching our goals
    * Publicly documenting your journey: 
        * ex: 100 days of code on twitter
# Hard Workers
* Surrounding yourself with hard workers makes you want to be a harder worker
